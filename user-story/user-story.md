**As a** player, **I want** to play games to increase my score, 
**so that** I can compete with other users.

 
- **Given** that I navigate to the website
- **When** I use the signup form
- **Then** my account in created and I am logged in
- **When** I click logout
- **Then** I am logged out and I return to the homepage.
- **When** I use the login form
- **Then** I am logged in if my credentials are correct and denied if they are not.
- **When** I am logged in a click on a game
- **Then** I am taken to that game's page and asked to wager a certain number of points
- **When** my points drop so low that I can no longer play any games
- **Then** I receive enough points to continue playing
- **When** I make my wager for heads or tails
- **Then** I am asked to pick heads or tails
- **When** I pick heads or tails
- **Then** a coin is flipped and I receive points if I guessed correct and lose points if I did not.
